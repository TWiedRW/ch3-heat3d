\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Body of paper.  Margins in this document are roughly 0.75 inches all
around, letter size paper.

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=3in]{fig1.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Consistency comparison in fitting surrogate model in the tidal
power example. \label{fig:first}}
\end{figure}

\begin{table}
\caption{D-optimality values for design $X$ under five different scenarios.  \label{tab:tabone}}
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{rrrrr}
one & two & three & four & five\\\hline
1.23 & 3.45 & 5.00 & 1.21 & 3.41 \\
1.23 & 3.45 & 5.00 & 1.21 & 3.42 \\
1.23 & 3.45 & 5.00 & 1.21 & 3.43 \\
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\end{table}

\begin{itemize}
\item Note that figures and tables (such as Figure~\ref{fig:first} and
Table~\ref{tab:tabone}) should appear in the paper, not at the end or
in separate files.
\item In the latex source, near the top of the file the command
\verb+\newcommand{\blind}{1}+ can be used to hide the authors and
acknowledgements, producing the required blinded version.
\item Remember that in the blind version, you should not identify authors
indirectly in the text.  That is, don't say ``In Smith et. al.  (2009) we
showed that ...''.  Instead, say ``Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...''.
\item These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements.
Please refer to the instructions for authors
at \url{http://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=ubes20&page=instructions#}
\item For more about ASA\ style, please see \url{http://journals.taylorandfrancis.com/amstat/asa-style-guide/}
\item If you have supplementary material (e.g., software, data, technical
proofs), identify them in the section below.  In early stages of the
submission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary
material.  Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at later stages.
\end{itemize}

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:meth}
Don't take any of these section titles seriously.  They're just for
illustration.

\section{Verifications}
\label{sec:verify}
This section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of
text looks like, for margins and spacing.
