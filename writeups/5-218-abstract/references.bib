  abstract = {As virtual reality becomes increasingly relevant in data analysis, understanding the implications of using 3D charts for data visualization is of paramount importance. In a virtual reality (VR) environment, users can obtain fresh insights and a deeper understanding of data through immersive exploration. VR introduces innovative possibilities for data visualization, thereby overcoming the limitations of traditional two-dimensional (2D) environments. However, limited research has examined the effectiveness of conventional three-dimensional (3D) chart representations for data analytics in VR. This study investigates the impact of traditional charts represented in 3D within VR on data analytics, focusing on interpretation accuracy, task time, long-term recall, and user preference. The results reveal a decline in interpretation accuracy with 3D charts, but improved long-term recall. Participants perceived limited success in accomplishing analytic tasks using this visualization method. These findings provide valuable insight into the advantages and limitations of using 3D charts for data visualization in the scientific domain within a VR setting, thereby enhancing our understanding of potential implications for data analytics in immersive environments.},

  abstract = {An experiment was performed to investigate the relationship between iwo-dimensional (2-D) or three-dimensional (3-D) graphs displayed on paper or computer and the problem-solving performance of experienced and novia managers. The effectsofthese variables on solution times, confidencein answersand effectivenessof solutions for a production management case were examined. It was predicted that experienced managers would engage in forward chaining as a problem-solving strategy, while novices would use backward chaining as a problem-solvingtechnique (Larkin et al. 1980).Results indicated that solution times were faster for computer than for paper presentations of data, but no significant relationship between response times and dimensionality of graphs was found. Novice subjects produced more accurate answers using 2-D paper presentations of graphs, while experienced managers produced more accurate answers when provided with 3-D graphs on computer. Further, experienced and novice managers were more confident of their answers when provided 2-D graphs as decision aids than with any other mode of presentation. Verbal protocols and retrospective reports indicated that in solving the casesexperienced managersengaged in forward chaining, backward chaining and means-ends analysis as problem-solving techniques more often than novices.},
