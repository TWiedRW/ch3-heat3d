  This document provides a basic template for the 2-page extended abstract and some submission guidelines. The authors' names and affiliations should not be included.^[Footnotes are also in smaller font. See @tbl-fontsizes for a list of font sizes.] Including an abstract is optional, as the document itself is an extended abstract. If included, an abstract should be a single paragraph.

# Introduction

We have based this SDSS template almost entirely on the template for the annual conference of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), whose template includes the following paragraph of credits:

> This document has been adapted from the instructions for earlier ACL proceedings, including those for ACL-2012 by Maggie Li and Michael White, those from ACL-2010 by Jing-Shing Chang and Philipp Koehn, those for ACL-2008 by Johanna D. Moore, Simone Teufel, James Allan, and Sadaoki Furui, those for ACL-2005 by Hwee Tou Ng and Kemal Oflazer, those for ACL-2002 by Eugene Charniak and Dekang Lin, and earlier ACL and EACL formats. Those versions were written by several people, including John Chen, Henry S. Thompson and Donald Walker. Additional elements were taken from the formatting instructions of the *International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence*.

# Methods

In preparing the extended abstract, we strongly encourage using the same four section headings seen here, namely, Introduction, Methods, Data (or Results), and Discussion (or Conclusions). Use of subsections is at the authors' discretion; see @sec-sections.

## Font Sizes and Layout

Extended abstracts should be no more than two pages, including references, in 10-point Times Roman font and two-column format, and must be submitted as pdf documents. The LaTeX template automatically uses the `newtx` package if available or `times` if not to select Times Roman. Please avoid changing the font size except, if desired, in the case of an extended quotation as demonstrated above.

Both LaTeX and MS Word templates may be downloaded by visiting the conference website:

**github.com/SDSS2020/SDSS-templates**

Margins should not be altered from those used in the template files.

| Type of Text | Font Size | Style |
|:-------------|----------:|:------|
| paper title | 15 pt | bold |
| author names | 12 pt | bold |
| author affiliation | 12 pt | |
| the word "Abstract" | 12 pt | bold |
| section titles | 12 pt | bold |
| document text | 10 pt | |
| captions | 10 pt | |
| abstract text | 10 pt | |
| bibliography | 10 pt | |
| footnotes | 9 pt | |

: Sizes and styles of fonts used. {#tbl-fontsizes}

## Sections {#sec-sections}

**Headings**: While it is permissible to use bold print to introduce a paragraph as seen here, please use the `section`, `subsection`, and `subsubsection` commands as in this document. If you are using MS Word, please duplicate the numbering and font-size conventions in this document.

### Numbering Sections

As shown here, all sections, sub-sections, and sub-subsections are numbered.

## Citations

In LaTeX, please use the `sdss2020` bibliography style, as demonstrated by this example document. MS Word users should duplicate the citation and reference section format seen here.

Citations within the text appear in parentheses as [@Nussbaum2018] or, if the author's name appears in the text itself, as Nussbaum [-@Nussbaum2018]. Treat double authors as in [@Wasserstein2016], but write as in [@Brunner] when more than two authors are involved. Collapse multiple citations as in [@LaVange2019; @Wasserstein2016]. As alluded to above, full citations should not be used as sentence constituents. For instance, instead of:

> "[@Arbuthnot1710] found the first $p$-value ..."

use:

> "Arbuthnot [-@Arbuthnot1710] found the first $p$-value ...".

Please make references complete, presentable, and consistent. When using BibTeX, protect capital letters of names and abbreviations in titles, as in `{B}ayesian` or `{EM}` algorithm, in your .bib file. For an example, notice that the "FDA" in the title of [@LaVange2019] is typed as `{FDA}` in the .bib file or else it would be incorrectly shown as "fda" in the references section.

## Footnotes

**Footnotes**: In LaTeX, use the `footnote` command^[This is how a footnote should appear.]. If using MS Word, please separate footnotes from the text by a line^[Note the line separating the footnotes from the text.].

# Data/Results

We encourage the selective use of tables and/or figures as appropriate.

## Graphics and Tables

Place figures and tables in the paper near where they are first discussed, rather than at the end, if possible. It is acceptable that wide illustrations may run across both columns. The use of color is allowed in extended abstract graphics.

```{r}
#| label: fig-bayes
#| fig-cap: "Ironically, Thomas Bayes was never asked to provide additional simulation studies in the Results sections of his papers."
#| echo: false
#| eval: false

# Example figure - replace with your actual figure
# knitr::include_graphics("bayes.png")
```

## Captions

Provide a caption below every figure and table; number each one sequentially in the form shown in @fig-bayes and @tbl-fontsizes.

# Discussion/Conclusions

## Appendices and Acknowledgements

Please avoid the use of appendices and acknowledgements as separate sections. Any pertinent material should be included in the body of the extended abstract rather than in an appendix. If acknowledgements are necessary, then they should be made using footnotes.

## Computer Code

If you wish to provide links to accompanying code, this is allowable because SDSS encourages best practices for reproducible research. However, all conclusions and exposition relevant to the refereeing process should appear in the body of the extended abstract; furthermore, we cannot guarantee that code will be checked or even consulted during the refereeing process.

## Refereeing Decisions

The review is **anonymous**. Accepted papers must be presented in person at SDSS in Milwaukee from April 28 to May 1, 2026. Accepted papers' authors will be notified in plenty of time to make registration and travel arrangements and for papers not accepted to submit a lightning abstract to the conference if they so choose.
