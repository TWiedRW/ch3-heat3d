## Study participation

Before we begin, please access (WEB LINK HERE) to participate in the pilot study!

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Methodology

## Goal

The goal of this experiment is to see how well participants estimate values across three chart types.

-   2D-digital (2dd)
-   3D-digital (3dd)
-   3D-printed (3dp)

## Stimuli Creation

We use the method of constant stimuli for creating our stimuli.

::: incremental
-   All values are between 0 and 100
-   The constant is 50
-   The largest value is 90
-   All other values between 50 and 90 are created such that the ratios between 0.556 and 1 are equally spaced
-   Values between 0 and 50 are chosen such that the same ratios as above are used

$$
S=\text{Stimuli}
$$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

```{r}
load('../../data/stimuli.rda')
theme_set(theme_bw())
stimuli %>% 
  rowwise() %>% 
  mutate(ratio = round(min(values, constant) / max(values, constant), 2)) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = pair_id, y = values)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = 'identity', color = 'black', fill = 'lightgreen') +
  geom_text(aes(x = 5, y = 54), label = 'Constant') +
  geom_text(aes(x = pair_id, y = min(values)/2, label = ratio)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 105), expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10) +
  labs(x = 'Pair ID', y = 'Value') + 
  theme(panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.minor.x = element_blank(),
        # axis.text.x = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks.x = element_blank(),
        aspect.ratio = 1/2)
```

## Generating Heatmap Data

The general shape of the heatmap is a mixture distribution between mathematical formula and uniform random noise.

$$
Z=0.3\cdot U(0,100) + 0.7\cdot f(X,Y)
$$

where $f(X,Y)$ is any given function, scaled between 0 and 100

-   Top half of a sphere centered at 5.5
-   Lower half of a sphere centered at 5.5

## Stimuli Placement

1)  Data is simulated from previous function to generate grid $(X=1\dots 10, Y=1\dots 10)$
2)  Non-50 value is placed onto grid coordinate that minimizes $|Z-S|$
3)  50 is placed similarly, but only on coordinates that have a Manhattan distance of 3 or 4

$$
|X_1-X_2|+|Y_1-Y_2| = 3 \text{ or } 4
$$

4)  Repeat process 20 times for a list of heatmaps
5)  Use Chi-squared tests to find heatmaps where stimuli are somewhat equally spaced

## Heatmap selection

With 9 pairs of values, it is expected to see 1.8 stimuli values in each row/column of the heatmap.

|               |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |       |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------|
| Grid Position | 1     | 2     | 3     | 4     | 5     | 6     | 7     | 8     | 9     | 10    |
| Expected      | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   | 1.8   |
| Observed      | $n_1$ | $n_2$ | $n_3$ | $n_4$ | $n_5$ | $n_6$ | $n_7$ | $n_8$ | $n_9$ | $n_10$ |

$$
\chi^2=\sum\frac{(\text{Observed}-\text{Expected})^2}{\text{Expected}}
$$

We use the grid with the smallest average $\chi^2$ for the $X$ and $Y$ axes.


# Study Design

## Study Design

For a full replicate, there are $3\times2\times9=54$ treatment combinations: 

- 3 media types (2dd, 3dd, 3dp)
- 2 datasets 
- 9 pairs of stimuli

Way too many trials for a single participant's attention span!

## Incomplete Block

Our main interest is the difference between media types, measured at a given ratio and dataset. To accomplish this and to reduce the number of trials per participant, we use 4 of the 9 possible stimuli pairs to create blocks.

$$
Y = \mu + P_i + S_j + \gamma_{ij} + D_k + M_l + (SD)_{jk} + (SM)_{jl} + (DM)_{kl} + (SDM)_{jkl} + e_{ijklm}
$$

where 

- $P_i$ is the effect of block $i$
- $S_j$ is the effect of stimuli pair $j$
- $\gamma_{ij}\sim N(0,\sigma^2_\gamma)$ is the 
- $D_k$ is the effect of dataset $k$
- $M_l$ is the effect of media type $l$
- $e_{ijklm}\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ is the random error

## Experiment

1) Ask participants which value in a stimuli pair is larger
2) Ask participants to estimate the value of the smaller stimuli
3) For each dataset and media combination, ask participant
